 # Readme Generator
> This is a project that uses InquirerPy to develop a function that generates a readme file from user replies to terminal prompts.

 ## Installation Instructions
  - Step 1: Clone the repository
 - Step 2: Install python 3.14
 - Step 3: Set up a virtual environment (in the repository or elsewhere) using: py -m venv venv
 - Step 4: Activate the virtual environment in linux or git bash terminal (location: folder containing venv) using: source venv/Scripts/activate
 - Step 5: Load the dependencies (in the python_code folder within the repository) using: py -m pip install -r requirements.text
 - Step 6: Run main.py (located within python_code)
 - Step 7: The required marked-down output can now be found in AUTOREADME.md in the repository folder, at the top level 

 ## Usage Information
 Note that extra markdown should not be inserted into the answers within the terminal, as this will not be interpreted as markdown by the function. Currently the completion of many of the fields is optional, and the input of an empty string for these fields will be handled gracefully by the generator function. Author first and last names are each optional, in case the author wishes to remain anonymous. There is the option to input only a first, or only a last name. The output file obviously needs to be transported to the correct repo, and renamed to README.md.
